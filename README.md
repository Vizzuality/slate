# Contributor guidelines

- Keep in mind that this documentation is used for Resource Watch, Aqueduct and Global Forest Watch - each of these projects will have it's own `/source/index-<project initials>.html.md`
- Contrary to what you may believe, Markdown rendering is not an exact science. Do test your changes by running the app server locally and checking the end result on the browser. Markdown preview tools output is known to be different from the HTML generated by this tool.
